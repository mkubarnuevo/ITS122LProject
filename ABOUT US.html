                        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                        <p>Cat Dog Cares was founded on October 16, 2021, but its mission began long before that. The founder, Ms. Ivy, started rescuing animals in 2018, driven by a deep love for cats and dogs—companions she had known since childhood. Growing up, her father would often bring home abandoned puppies and kittens, giving them a chance at life. However, without proper knowledge of animal care, they felt helpless when their pets fell sick, especially when faced with life-threatening illnesses.</p>
                        <p>Tragedy struck early on. The family's beloved dogs—Bagsik, Bamba, and Harry—all fell victim to animal cruelty in their community. Harry was found hanging from a tree, a rope tied around his neck. Bagsik, a large and affectionate dog, was taken and butchered, his remains left in the fields. Bamba was stolen from their home, with traces of blood on the ground hinting at a cruel fate. Their story was not unique—many animals in the area suffered the same horrors, and as a child, she felt powerless to stop it.</p>
                        <p>As the years passed, the cruelty continued. Stray cats were poisoned, helpless dogs were sold for as little as 500 pesos to be slaughtered. Even those meant to protect—soldiers—took part in the cycle of violence. With no solid proof and no power to fight back, she carried the pain and frustration, determined to create change.</p>
                        <p>Cat Dog Cares was born out of a promise to protect those who cannot speak for themselves. It is a sanctuary for the voiceless, a movement against animal cruelty, and a beacon of hope for every cat and dog that deserves love, safety, and a second chance at life.</p>
                        <p>But the fight is far from over. The founder freams of making Cat Dog Cares stronger, bigger, and more powerufle in order to rescue, educate, and advocate until no animal has to suffer again.</p>
